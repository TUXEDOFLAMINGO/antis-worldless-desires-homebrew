This corporeal form uses the {@creature depth spirit|TuxsHomebrewModule|Depth Spirit} stat block. When you summon the creature, choose Gorger, Collector, or Lurker. The creature resembles a monstrous entity of that kind, which determines certain traits in its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or after 1 hour (requiring concentration). The creature is an ally to you and your companions. In combat, the creature shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its move to avoid danger. This property can't be used again until the next dawn."
